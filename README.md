# Machine Learning and Deep Learning models
This bioinformatic python scripts are used to generate ML and DL models, to predict proteins transporters. 
In ML models, it was applied seven model types: SVM, Random Forest, Linear Regression, Naive-Bayes, Decision tree, KNN, Gradient Boosting.
In DL models we preform three types of models: CNN, RNN and hybrid CNN-RNN.

The general pipeline is shown below:
